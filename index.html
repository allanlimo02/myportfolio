            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Allan Limo, a 23 year old, living in Nairobi. I'm currently a student at Moringa School pursuing a
                course in Software
                Development, perfecting my skills in Web development while specializing in full-stack development and
                user experience. My
                interests extend beyond programming. When am not coding am probably hanging out with my friends and
                family, reading novels
                or tech articles while enjoying enjoy a good cup of coffee, watching good movies or nature
                documentaries.
                <br>
                Theres nothing more exiciting than finding a new idea or solutions, that would have a positive impact on
                people.
                I've always been passionate about technology since i was in school hence choose to major in Software
                Engineering in college.
                A couple of years later its still what am most excited about and pursuing it as a carreer. Helping
                people and making a difference
                everyday is something i enjoy doing and this career allows me to do that. When i heard of Moringa School
                i knew it would be great
                opportunity for me to more and explore new concepts and ideas as in the tech world you can never learn
                enough.
